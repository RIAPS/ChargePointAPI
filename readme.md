# ChargePoint API database
Esther Ling, 2018

## Overview
This is a script to pull usage data from ChargePoint API and save it into an SQL database.

## Instructions
1. Insert your organization's username and password in the main() function.
2. Set the startTime and endTime as the beginning of the day, i.e. midnight 00:00:00. Example: datetime(2018, 1, 01, 00, 00, 00).
3. Edit the "startTime" and "endTime" parameters to the time range that you want to pull data from.
4. ChargePoint's API limits each call to a maximum of 100 sessions. I've coded this under the assumption that there are no more than 100 sessions per day (which you will need to modify if usage in your area is higher than this).

## Table Schema
The database schema can be found in a Google Slide [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P1bULtDGcgMSYChIWzFjT7LfT-BbQs-qWxjKsioeGKc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Example
See Notebooks folder for an Exploratory Jupyter notebook. I was making use of plotnine, a Python package that is built to mimic ggplot (R).

## Package Dependencies

## Update

To get the 15 min charging session break down run the "createEVdb.py" file with the "record15minsession" flag set: `python3 createEVdb.py -r`
